Dear {!Registration__c.Guardian__c},

We have received notice that your camper has a nut allergy. We at The Campground have an action plan in place to help prevent any reactions during the camper's time at camp.

1. A nut free menu
2. Disclosure to fellow guardians about sending snacks with their campers
3. Response trained counselors with quick access to Epipens 
4. Safety and respect introduction at the start of the camp program

Thank you for working with us to ensure your camper's best experience at The Campground,

Sincerely,
{!Registration__c.CreatedBy}
